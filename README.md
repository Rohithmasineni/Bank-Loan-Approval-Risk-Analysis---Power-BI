## Bank-Loan-Approval-Risk-Analysis---Power-BI

## Project Overview

This project addresses a real-world business problem:

##### How can financial institutions identify high-risk loan applicants using data-driven insights?

Using customer demographic, employment, savings, and loan-related attributes, this end-to-end analytics project explores and validates Risk Weightings (1 to 5) assigned to loan applicants. The goal is to enable banks and lenders to assess loan approval risk effectively and reduce chances of default.

## Business Objective

To assist banks and financial institutions in identifying which customer profiles are riskier to lend money to, and why â€” based on patterns in income, savings, employment type, and more. This empowers lenders to make more confident, data-backed decisions and improve loan portfolio health.

## Key Insights

â€¢	Majority of customers in Risk 5 had low income, no savings, and were unemployed

â€¢	Merely having savings does not guarantee lower risk â€” job type and credit history play crucial roles

â€¢	Certain customer segments (e.g., freelancers and daily wage earners) consistently appear in high-risk zones

â€¢	Education level positively correlates with lower risk

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data can support better loan risk assessment and more responsible lending. By understanding the "why" behind high-risk profiles, decision-makers can mitigate risk, improve ROI, and serve customers more fairly.
